# Tools for visualisation of mobility flows
We visualise transport flows using various techniques:
1. kepler.gl, which can be also integrated to python www.kepler.gl/ [1]
2. scikit-mobility python module https://scikit-mobility.github.io/scikit-mobility/index.html, which is a library for human mobility analysis in Python [2]
3. open libraries in Python: osmnx: https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx to work with openstreetmaps directly [3]
